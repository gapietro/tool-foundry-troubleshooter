# Seed 01 — tool schema mismatch

| | |
|---|---|
| **Expected root-cause layer** | `tool_schema` (layer 3) |
| **Expected fix target** | the tool input schema |
| **Fluent source** | `../seed-app/src/fluent/seed-01-schema-mismatch.now.ts` |
| **Agent name** | Seed 01 Ticket Prioritizer |
| **Also stresses** | artifact paging — this seed is built to produce a LARGE trace |

## The defect

`set_ticket_priority` declares `priority` as a free string, and the instructions
require the agent to express priority in words. The column
`x_snc_tsbench_ticket.priority` is an integer choice, 1–5. The word never
matches a choice value, the write coerces to empty, and `gr.update()` reports
success — so the agent tells the user the ticket was prioritised.

## Why it is built this way

The instructions are deliberately verbose and multi-step. Seed 1 is the
benchmark's artifact-paging stressor: the native harness's weakest documented
area is large evidence, and a benchmark of five small traces would never
exercise it.

**Deviation from LLD §7, recorded not hidden.** §7 specifies writing to
`incident.priority`. This seed writes to `x_snc_tsbench_ticket`, a table the
fixture app owns. R-19 measured that a scoped app cannot always reach a global
table — `syslog` stays `DENIED` even with a self-declared `sys_scope_privilege`.
A seed that failed at the scope boundary would be correctly diagnosed as a
privilege problem, and would score as a miss on `tool_schema`. The defect under
test is unchanged; the obstacle in front of it is removed.

## Setup

1. Install the fixture app (Task 12): `cd benchmark/seed-app && now-sdk install --alias gpinst01`
2. Insert one bench ticket with `short_description` set and `priority` empty.
   Record its sys_id.

## Trigger

Open a fresh conversation with **Seed 01 Ticket Prioritizer** and give it the
ticket sys_id plus an urgent-sounding description — e.g. *"the payment gateway
is down for all customers, no workaround"*. Capture the resulting
`sn_aia_execution_plan` sys_id.

## Expected diagnosis

Root cause in `tool_schema`: the tool's `priority` input is a free string while
the target column is an integer choice 1–5. Fix target: the tool input schema
(constrain to 1–5, or map words to values before the write).

Evidence a correct diagnosis should cite: the trace showing
`priority_stored` empty in the tool result, plus the column definition.

## Safety

Touches only `x_snc_tsbench_ticket`, owned by the fixture app. Nothing shared.
